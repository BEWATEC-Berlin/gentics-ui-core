# Gentics UI Core

This is the common core framework for the Gentics CMS and Mesh UI apps.

## Build

Although the UI Core is intended to be consumed in a raw (uncompiled) state, there is also a demo app included
under `./src/demo` which will serve as a ["living style guide"](https://uxmag.com/articles/anchoring-your-design-language-in-a-live-style-guide)
as well as a way to manually test each of the core components.

1. `npm install`
2. `typings install`
3. `gulp watch`
4. Serve the contents of the `build/demo` folder
